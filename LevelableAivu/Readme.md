A mod to make Aivu's levelups controllable.

What it does:
You can now pick what feats and spells Aivu takes on levelup.
Aivu can now equip animal companion specific items if other requirements are met.
Aivu's dragonfear is a toggle.


Optional Components:
Aivu can take barding proficiency feats
Aivu's spell list includes the bard list per TT havoc dragons.

Installation and Compatability considerations:
You will need to respec immediately if you are already an Azata - ideally respec, save before re-picking Azata, install, then pick Azata.
I have made no attempt to account for an existing Aivu on install.
Any mod that alters any portion of Aivu's existing progression will be non-functional and may break things - I deep-sixed all of that in the process of making this.

New items and spells should work just fine.

Balance considerations:

Aivu was already really powerful, being essentially party member number seven. Being able to optimize her build and pick her spells and give her armor will only make her stronger.

Permissions:
Feel free to borrow the code and integrate into your own mod, just give me a shoutout.
